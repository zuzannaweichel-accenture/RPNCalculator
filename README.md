An RPN calculator computes expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation.

An RPN expression or postfix expression is one of the following :

* a number `X`, in wich case the value of the expression is that of X,
* a sequence of form `E1 E2 OP` where `E1` and `E2` are RPN expressions and `OP` is an arithmetic operation.

Samples :

    20 5 /        => 20/5 = 4
    4 2 + 3 -     => (4+2)-3 = 3
    3 5 8 * 7 + * => ((5*8)+7)*3 = 141

Add the SQRT operation :

    9 SQRT => âˆš9 = 3

Add the MAX operation :

    5 3 4 2 9 1 MAX   => MAX(5, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1) = 9
    4 5 MAX 1 2 MAX * => MAX(4,5) * MAX(1,2) = 10
